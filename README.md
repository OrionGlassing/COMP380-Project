# Project Root Directory

    Here is included both the backend files in Django and the Expo Go application for the frontend. I've went ahead
    and set up the basics and included detailed notes in most sections that should help understand the workplace I've created as well as how it works a little. Almost every section should have a `README.md` that I've written so when we're making functional API calls on our app eventually, you'll need to read them and get caught up with speed if you want to test backend features for development on your own personal device when you pull this repository. 

    A couple things I learned is that Expo Go has a default template, so I've let that one remain 
    but slightly modified the `README.md` file. I detailed the backend with explanations on how to operate it.
